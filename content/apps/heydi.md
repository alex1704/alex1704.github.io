How many times have you avoided interacting with an AI assistant because it demanded too much of your attention? You had to switch to web chat, wait for a response, then return to where you were before. And that's the best-case scenario if you have the patience to wait for your answer to cook. Wouldn't it be easier if you could simply ask the AI chat to do its thing without switching contexts?

Heydi allows you to effortlessly record an audio message for the AI chat with minimal effort. Just set up a Quick Action in the Shortcuts app, assign a keyboard shortcut to it, and you're ready to go! Start recording audio for the web chat effortlessly, and perhaps by the time the answer is ready, you'll have more thoughts on the subject.

*The application utilizes OpenAI's API to generate and transcribe audio.*

\
Key features:
- Record audio messages for AI web chat.
- Shortcuts support for key actions: start/stop message recording, cancel message recording, and bring the web chat window to the front.
- Access web chat with a single click on the status bar icon.
- Generate audio from web chat responses.
- Support ChatGPT by OpenAI (with plans to add support for more web chat providers).
