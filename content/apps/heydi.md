Mac app that allows you to interact with AI web chats effortlessly:
* Non-intrusive: send and receive chat messages while staying focused on your tasks
* Generate prompts with your voice and/or clipboard
* Open the chat window on any screen

How many times have you avoided interacting with an AI assistant because it demanded too much of your attention? You had to switch to web chat, wait for a response, and then return to your previous task. And that's assuming you have the patience to wait for your answer to cook. Wouldn't it be easier if you could simply ask the AI chat to do its thing without switching contexts?

Heydi's goal is to streamline userâ€™s interaction with various web chats, eliminating the need to divert attention from main objectives. Just set up a Quick Action in the Shortcuts app, assign a keyboard shortcut to it, and you're ready to go! The main funtionality of the app is accessible via Quick Actions - you can prompt chat with your voice, use the clipboard, or toggle chat window visibility. When the answer is ready, Heydi can generate and play the chat response audio for you. Plus, as a status bar app, it's just one action away from opening on any screen.
