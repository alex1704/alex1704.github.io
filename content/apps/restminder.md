Are you tired of working non-stop on a task, only to feel burnt out and exhausted at the end? It's time to take a break and enjoy the process. With RestMinder, you can create task timers to ensure that you take regular breaks during your hard work.

RestMinder offers a variety of useful features to help you stay on track and maintain your productivity. With its Pomodoro mode, you can set a timer for a specific period of work, followed by a short break. This technique has been shown to boost productivity and creativity while reducing stress and burnout.

Additionally, RestMinder provides reminders based on the 20-20-20 rule, which suggests that every 20 minutes, you should take a break and look 20 feet (6 meters) away for 20 seconds. This can help reduce eye strain and improve your overall well-being.

To make sure you stay on top of your tasks, RestMinder also offers the ability to open the Apple Notes app automatically when a task's time elapses. And with progress charts, you can track your productivity and see how much you've accomplished over time.

Don't let hard work take a toll on your health and well-being. Download RestMinder today and enjoy the benefits of taking regular breaks during your workday.
